# Lmu-Times
CMSI 1010 Final Project: Implemented a rudimentary version of Wordle from The NY Times using pygame.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### The LMU Times Presents: Wordle!

Welcome to the Wordle game by the LMU Times! In this game, you will be given a random five letter word that you must guess correctly. You will be given six tries to guess the word. After each guess, you will be able to see whether or not the word you guessed is correct. If your guess is not correct, you will be able to see whether each individual letter is in the correct spot, not in the correct spot but in the word, or just not in the word at all. If you are able to guess the word correctly, congratulations! You win!

Each guess must be only five letters long, nothing more and nothing less. Additionally, only letters (A-Z) are used; there are no numbers. Use your keyboard to type in and submit your answers.

In order to play this game, you must download the "request" library and the "pygame" library. You will use "pip install _" in order to do so. You will then be able to run the code and play until your heart's content!
