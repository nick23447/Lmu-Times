CMSI 1010 Final Project: Implemented a rudimentary version of Wordle from The NY Times using pygame.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### The LMU Times Presents: Wordle!

The LMU Times Presents: Wordle!
Welcome to the Wordle game by the LMU Times! In this game, you will be given a random five-letter word that you must guess correctly. You get six attempts. After each guess, the game shows you whether each letter is:

- Correct and in the correct position
- Present in the word but in the wrong position
- Not in the word at all

If you guess the word — congratulations! You win.
All guesses must be exactly five letters (A–Z). Use your keyboard to type and submit guesses.
